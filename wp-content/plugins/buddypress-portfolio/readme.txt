This Buddypress plugin allows each user to create his portfolio on your website.

== Description ==

BP-Portfolio is a BuddyPress plugin that allows members to create their own portfolio (a set of projects : IT projects, recipes, achievements of designer, ... ).

Right now each project includes a title, a description, an url and a screenshot of the project. The size of the description can be defined in the admin panel, as the template to be used.

The plugin provides the following features :

*   a new tab in the user profile listing their projects
*   a new page listing all projects,
